Instead, just lower the torso straight down as you bend the knees and move the left foot out into position. The feeling should be one of compressing the right leg downward by bending the knee.\n\nBring both fists by the right waist in no particular position, and then snap them up and around strongly. The left arm performs a high level inside block with the back of the fist. The right arm performs an upper level rising block. The forearm and fist of the right arm point forward in the same direction as the toes of your right foot, and the left arm should be pointed upward directly.\n\nThe knuckles of the right hand should point at the height of the left wrist. The forearms should be about 8 inches apart so that your face will fit between them. The wrists of both arms must be perfectly straight. The left elbow is at a perfect 90 degrees angle as is the left shoulder. The right shoulder should be at 45 degrees, and the right elbow should be at around 100 to 110 degrees.\n\nWhen finished, this technique forms a nice rectangle between the arms when viewed from the front of the room. When viewed from the side, the arms are far enough (Redmond, 2006, p. 148).",

	"performance_annotations": ["**Reverse Inside Block** - Remember this technique, because you'll need it later when you try to perform Bassai Dai. Shift the left foot over to the left about 45 degrees to form a new front stance. Fold the arms for a right inside block, but keep the hips halffacing as you fold the arms. Most people make the mistake of folding the arms and turning the hips forward before they actually start the blocking action. Pay attention to when you turn the hips during your block. Don't think on a macro level block=hip turn. Think about each piece of the block and each piece of the hip turning action.\n\nOnce the foot settles into place, reverse inside block with the right hand, turning the hips strongly to the reverse half-facing position. No, you can't really make your pelvis aim 45 degrees in the other direction. The best you can do is get it to squarely face the target. You'll have to turn your shoulders and twist your spine past the point that your hips will turn. You will learn, as you progress through karate training, that whether to keep the shoulders synchronized and fixed to the motion of the pelvis will be a conditional thing that changes depending on the conditions you are in and the technique you are performing. In this case, the shoulders go past the point where the hips turn. When you throw reverse punches, doing so is considered a big, fat no-no.\n\nAs you perform this block, there will be several side-effects. The first is that your front knee will want to straighten, because in order to twist up this much, you really need a higher, shorter stance. The usual solution by most kata champions is to pull the front foot back about six inches without straightening the knee.\n\nAnother side effect is that when you try to rotate to the reverse half-facing posture, you can't, so you end up pushing your hips away from the rear leg of the stance to the side. Be careful to keep the pelvis in front of that support leg. You'll have to actively push it into position until a few years of training go by (Redmond, 2006, p. 150).",
